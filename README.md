## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Google Material Design Inspiration
- **Clean Typography**: Used Google's Geist font family for modern readability
- **Rounded Corners**: Consistent 12px-24px border radius for modern feel
- **Shadow System**: Layered shadows for depth and hierarchy
- **Color Palette**: Blue and purple gradients with neutral grays
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px-based spacing throughout

### Animation Strategy
- **Performance First**: Used transform-based animations for 60fps performance
- **Meaningful Motion**: Animations enhance UX rather than distract
- **Staggered Loading**: Product cards animate in sequence for visual appeal
- **Spring Physics**: Natural, bouncy animations using spring configurations
- **Layout Animations**: Smooth transitions when filtering/sorting products

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: Used useState and useCallback for local state management
- **Derived State**: Computed properties using useMemo for performance
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates for better perceived performance

## 🔧 API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /products` - Fetch all products with pagination
- `GET /products/category/{category}` - Fetch products by category
- `GET /products/{id}` - Fetch single product details
- `GET /products/categories` - Fetch all categories
- `GET /products/search` - Search products (future enhancement)

### Data Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Fetch products and categories on app mount
2. **Category Filter**: Fetch category-specific products when filter changes
3. **Client-side Processing**: Search and sort performed client-side for responsiveness
4. **Pagination**: Client-side pagination with smooth transitions

## 🎭 Animation Showcase

### Staggered List Animations
Products appear with a beautiful stagger effect, creating a wave-like entrance that guides the user's eye naturally across the grid.

### Modal Transitions
The product detail modal uses scale and opacity animations with a backdrop blur effect, creating a native app-like experience.

### Micro-interactions
- **Button Feedback**: Buttons scale down on press and up on hover
- **Card Hover**: Product cards lift and show subtle shadows on hover
- **Loading States**: Smooth skeleton animations while content loads
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth fade transitions when changing pages

### Physics-based Motion
All animations use spring physics for natural, organic movement that feels responsive and alive.

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 640px - Single column layout
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px - Two column layout
- **Desktop**: > 1024px - Four column layout
- **Large Desktop**: > 1280px - Optimized spacing and typography

### Mobile Optimizations
